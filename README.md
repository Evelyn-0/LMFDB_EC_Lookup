# LMFDB EC Lookup
A python script to get large datasets of elliptic curves from the LMFDB API

Documentation coming soon!!!!!

You could probably just run the LMFDB_Lookup.py file and it'll work in the way I wrote it for my research. Otherwise you'll have to wait or ask me for how to use it. Sorry :(

# LMFDB EC Lookup

A python script to get large datasets of elliptic curves from the LMFDB API

Update (9/24/2025) This code doesn't really work anymore. I never got around to updating it with documentation but now the LMFDB API will send captchas in response to requests after a few loops and this code cannot automatically solve them, so it just gets stuck getting these captchas. Maybe some day I will come back to it. LMFDB also has a SQL mirror now that might be better.
